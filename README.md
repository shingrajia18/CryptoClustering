# CryptoClustering

## Overview
This project involves clustering cryptocurrencies based on their price fluctuations across various timeframes using machine learning techniques such as K-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA).

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset (`crypto_market_data.csv`) required for analysis.
- `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Instructions
The notebook contains detailed explanations and code for each step of the process, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Results
- Clustering of cryptocurrencies based on price fluctuations using K-means clustering.
- Visualization of clusters using scatter plots.
- Reduction of feature dimensions using PCA.
- Determination of feature weights on principal components.
- Optimization of clusters using PCA data.
